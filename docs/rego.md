### Rego

Rego is Open Policy Agent's native query language that inspects the data published by services and users. 
Its creation was influenced by [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog), a declarative logic programming query language used for 
deductive databases. Rego goes well beyond Datalog to support structured document models. Its queries help define policies identify data violations. 
Rego can be a steep learning curve for users.

Some benefits of Rego are:

- Simplistic reading and writing of policies. 
- Powerful support of referenced nested documents.
- Queries that accurate and unambiguous.
- Declarative
