# Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper

The Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper (OPA) assists in enforcing, monitoring, and remediating policies while strengthening governance of an environment. It provides integration between OPA and Kubernetes.
OPA Gatekeeper controls the policies for Kubernetes and acts as a customizable Kubernetes Admission Webhook. Its audit functionality offers constant monitoring of existing clusters to detect policy violations. 

OPA Gatekeeper functionality includes:

- [An extensible, parameterized policy library](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/core/policy/-/blob/documentation-standard/docs/policylibrary.md).
- A high level language, [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), to create policies.
- [Constraints/Constraint Templates](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/core/policy/-/blob/documentation-standard/docs/ConstraintTemplates.md).
- [Security](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/core/policy/-/blob/documentation-standard/docs/sso-integration.md)  
- [Test framework](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/core/policy/-/blob/documentation-standard/docs/test.md) for developing tests for policies.

The main focus of OPA Gatekeeper is to assist in applying Best Practices, Security, and policies in the Kubernetes environment. We will also look at Disaster Recovery and Troubleshooting for OPA Gatekeeper.
